You can also call me Ryan Wang. I am a freshman at John Hopcroft Class, Zhiyuan College, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. You can reach me by dropping emails to ziwuvalley[AT]sjtu[DOT]edu[DOT]cn or sending messages to my twitter account. I am mainly interested in Theoretical Computer Science and Quantum Computing, especially the overlap of these two fields. Currently, I am focusing on these following topics: Quantum Complexity Theory Quantum Learning Theory Quantum Machine Learning for Combinatorial Optimization I will post my CV here when my experience become various.","link":"/about/index.html"}]}
